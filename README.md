# Example Display for Building Information
The purpose of this example display is a possibility for how we can make the data that is collected by the sensors more human-readable, so anyone can intuitively understand what the sensors and user data are telling them - therefore making this information more accessible to anyone who wishes to be informed. The application would have many features:
- First, the user will see the positions of all sensors in each of the rooms. This floorplan is interactive, and clicking on a sensor will allow the user to see data from that sensor.
- The “Sensor Information” bubble will populate with information about a specific sensor when it is clicked on the floorplan map.
- The information will be from a specific time, as selected using the time scroll bar on the bottom of the map. This scroll bar will also auto-populate the “User Comments” dialogue box with user comments on the app from this time. It is currently filled with a placeholder to show what it would look like.
- In the sensor information box, the user can find information about each of the data points, and what these measurements actually mean. They also have the option to "See Recommendations" which allows them to get a narrative of what all of this data is telling them about their building.
- The user can see the weather from that week as well as the outdoor climate, which factors into their indoor climate.

*Potential future additions:*
- It could be useful to have a mode where you can see the changes of all sensors (using the time scroll) over time.
- There could be different interfaces built for different individuals based on their relationship with the building - i.e. for building admins versus utilities people, since they would require different information.
- This feature is included for appearance but not implemented, but the user can click “Show Overlay” if they want to see an extrapolated heat map over the floor plan.
